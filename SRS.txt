INTRODUCTION
------------------------------------------------

This is an informal Software Requirements Specification document.

I've got an interest in sprint technique to help me to
concentrate at task at hand, as well as to develop ability
to estimate the time required to finish certain tasks.

As for december 2014, I haven't found software I was looking for.
As the matter of fact, I found one cloud service that met all requirements,
but it was unreliable to the point that it could not be used for a few days
in a row. This was not the first time when I was disappointed in cloud-based
app, so I wanted a stand-alone application.

As I could not find stand-alone application that meets my requirements,
I decided to write it myself. Maybe I will open-source it when most of
the features are completed.

USER REQUIREMENTS
------------------------------------------------

Core features
-------------

    - Application should support Pomodoro technique workflow (pomodoros should be
        interleaved with short and long breaks)
        * After submitting sprint, short break should be started automatically
        * After completing specified number of pomodoros in a row, long break should
          be started automatically
        * When sprint or break is completed, User should be notified

    - User should be able to configure following parameters (not sure yet if on runtime)
        * sprint duration (in minutes)
        * short break duration (in minutes)
        * long break duration (in minutes)
        * number of pomodoros to be completed before the long break
        * sound file to be used for notification (in mp3 format) or not use sound at all

    - User should be able to provide a description of task he accomplished when
      submitting sprint

    - User should be able to see a list submitted pomodoros
        * User should see 16 last submitted pomodoros
        * Pomodoros should be ordered by last submitted to first submitted

    - User should be able to select 'In The Zone' mode, where he will not be distracted
        by any signals, and application will run sprint tasks in cycle, ignoring breaks.
        Such mode is useful, when working, say on programming task and each distraction
        comes with a price.

    - User should be able to keep a list of tasks, called Todo items
        * Todo items can optionally contain multiple tags, prefixed with character '#'
        * Todo items can optionally contain number, prefixed with character '*'. This
          number should be treated like estimated number of pomodoros, this task could take
        * Todo items list should support filtering by tag.
        * Selecting item from the list when submitting sprint should copy item description
          to sprint description
        * Items in list should contain information about number of pomodoros spent and
          number of pomodoros estimated, if number of estimated pomodoros was specified
        * User should be able to edit/delete item in the list
        * When User decides that he has done the task, he could 'complete' it. Task should
          then be removed from the list (but information about task should be stored)

    - User should be able to set goals (number of pomodoros to complete)
        * User should be able to set how many pomodoros he plans
          to complete for a day, week and month
        * User should be able to keep track of his progress towards reaching the goals

    - User should be able to access all stored pomodoros and todo items
        * User should be able to manually add/edit/delete pomodoros and todo items

    - User should be able to get statistical information
        * average pomodoros completed for day, week, month, year
        * best workday/week/month (most pomodoros completed)
        * best working hours
        * total pomodoros completed (optional)
        * statistics should be represented in human-friendly format
          (like diagrams, graphs, etc.)

Optional features
-----------------

    - User should be able to import completed pomodoros from a CSV file with a specified fields

    - User can configure sprint time, break time, long break time

    - User can configure how many pomodoros should be completed before a long break

    - User can backup application data to another machine or cloud service

    - User should be able to sync data (on local network) with android application (if it
      will be written)

    - Weekly and monthly reports

CONSTRAINTS

- Application should work on GNU/Linux operation system
